    What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?

     a. IS_SUCCESSFUL column.

    What variable(s) are considered to be the features of your model?

     b. Every column except the drop.

    What variable(s) are neither targets nor features and should be removed from the input data?
  
     c. 'EIN' & 'NAME'

# Step 3: Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

The neural network model using Tensorflow Keras contains working code that performs the following steps:
The number of layers, the number of neurons per layer, and activation function are defined  <br>

An output layer with an activation function is created  <br>

There is an output for the structure of the model  <br>
There is an output of the modelâ€™s loss and accuracy <br>
The model's weights are saved every five epochs <br>
The results are saved to an HDF5 file  <br>

#### Deliverable 3 Requirements

Noisy variables are removed from features <br>
Additional neurons are added to hidden layers  <br>
Additional hidden layers are added <br> 
The activation function of hidden layers or output layers is changed for optimization  <br>
The model's weights are saved every five epochs  <br>
The results are saved to an HDF5 file  <br>

   ![Figure 5](https://github.com/davidhyongae2/network/blob/main/Figure6.png) <br>

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? <br>
layer1 = 80, layer2 = 30. to create a testable and training set. <br>
Were you able to achieve the target model performance? <br> 
yes, at an accuracy of 0.7286 <br>
What steps did you take to try to increase model performance? <br>
100 Epoch steps. 50 epochs, and lastly 30 epochs and a period of 5. <br>

#### Summary: 
The model did well at 73%. I recommend an epoch of 30 to reach the optimal value. A deep model may be a good model to use if more than one possible solution node can be observed. A neural network is another trained model that visualizes node networks to arrive at a predicted model or process.
